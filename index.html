<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>There seems to be a new trend in the IT-world: “chat bots” or with a trendier name: “conversational bots” and all the big companies are jumping on the hype train. </p>

<h2>
<a id="the-latest-trends" class="anchor" href="#the-latest-trends" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The latest trends</h2>

<p>“Wait a minute”, I hear you say, “haven’t chat bots existed for years?”. Yes, chat bots have existed for quite a while. Alan Turing’s Turing test coined the first concept for chat bots and that was in 1950. As early as 1966 the first real chat bot was developed. Since then the development of chat bots hasn’t halted. These days everyone has used or knows Siri, Cortana and Google Now. So what’s different this time?</p>

<p>To understand what’s different we need to understand the latest trends. The use of apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger is booming. Slack is the fastest-growing workplace software ever. The way we communicate and work is evolving and the future spells “chat applications”. </p>

<p>The big companies have noticed this trend. Naturally they want to adapt their business so they can profit from this change. But how can a business integrate its products in a chat application? It’s fundamentally different from a website or a Facebook page. </p>

<h2>
<a id="conversational-bots-1" class="anchor" href="#conversational-bots-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conversational bots</h2>

<p>The simple answer is conversational bots! You make your product a part of the conversation. Do you want to order a taxi? Ask the Uber conversational bot! Want to order some food? Tell the just eat conversational bot you’re hungry! Want to order some new shoes? Ask the conversational bot of your local shoe shop!</p>

<p>But how do you make such a bot? And how do you integrate it in the existing chat applications? Well luckily for us developers the chat applications are way ahead of us. Both Facebook and Slack are heavily investing in the development of conversational bots. They are opening their development platforms so it’s easy to make your own bot and they are adapting their applications so you can integrate your bot without a worry.</p>

<p>Other companies are quickly following. Google, Windows and Facebook and many others are making their AI publicly available (or for a fair price). There’s a wildfire of startups that provide platforms and integration tools. Many companies already have developed or are developing their bot. Business is booming!</p>

<h2>
<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Is this trend to last? Or is this just a hype that will disappear in a few years? It’s hard to say. </p>

<p>On the one hand, large companies are investing heavily in these bots. Facebook said on its F8 conference that conversational are a big part of their long term view. Other companies are buying startups that are specialized in Artificial Intelligence. They seem to believe there’s a future in conversational bots.</p>

<p>On the other hand, conversation bots still have a long way to go. Most people are quickly frustrated when using conversation bots because, to put it frankly, most conversational bots aren’t very smart. They have a lot of difficulties handling edge cases and it doesn’t take long before they say something that’s completely out of place. This is normal. Artificial Intelligence is hard. It will take quite a while before these bots can replace humans.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it’s an interesting trend. I certainly encourage everyone to try it out. The tools make it very easy for a developer. You should have a bot up and running in a few hours.</p>

<a id="experimenting" class="anchor" href="#experimenting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experimenting</h1>

<p>After doing some research with Google I quickly stumbled on a few interesting companies. Beepboop and Wit.ai. The first is an integration platform the later a natural language processer (or NLP).</p>

<h2>
<a id="beepboop" class="anchor" href="#beepboop" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Beepboop</h2>

<p>Beepboop (beepboophq.com) is an integration platform. Its main goal is to make it as easy as possible to build, deploy and integrate your bot into Slack. Lately they are also working into integrating your bot into Facebook messenger.</p>

<h3>
<a id="first-experience" class="anchor" href="#first-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First experience</h3>

<p>Beepboop works directly on your GitHub repositories. With a few clicks you’ll attach one of your repositories to Beepboop or create a new repository with a skeleton project. </p>

<p>Afterwards Beepboop will automatically build and deploy your project. It expects a Dockerfile in the root of your project and a server.js file to bootstrap your application. Nothing more.</p>

<p>To integrate your Beepboop application with Slack, you just have to follow their wizard. It’s very clearly explained and normally you should have your bot up and running in a few minutes.</p>

<p>All in all, Beepboop has a very nice user experience. One of the best that I know.</p>

<h2>
<a id="slapp" class="anchor" href="#slapp" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Slapp</h2>

<p>To implement the basics of my bot I use the Slapp library because this was already installed in the BeepBoop skeleton project. The more popular option would be to use botkit, which seems to have a very similar api. I haven’t had time yet to compare the two more deeply so I can tell you more about the differences between them.</p>

<h3>
<a id="first-experience-1" class="anchor" href="#first-experience-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First experience</h3>

<p>The api is very easy to understand. It’s a simple event listener system. Each listener will listen to a list of events (direct message, mention, general conversation, someone entering the channel) and will apply a regex on the text of the event.</p>

<p>The listener can then reply with a text, reply with an attachment or reply with a question (providing a few custom answers in the form of interactive buttons). </p>

<p>The library also allows to start a conversation. This way it can more easily capture the answer on a question without you needing to look up what question the user is replying to.</p>

<h2>
<a id="witai" class="anchor" href="#witai" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wit.AI</h2>

<p>Wit.AI is a NLP which means it can “understand” what a user is asking, but lacks the knowledge on how to answer. To let it have a conversation, the developer needs to provide a list of custom scenario’s. </p>

<h3>
<a id="first-experience-2" class="anchor" href="#first-experience-2" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First experience</h3>

<p>What Wit.AI does is trying to understand what the user is saying. This he will reflect to the developer as a list of entities. </p>

<p>An entity has a type and a value. An example of an entity is “intent”. So when a user asks “What’s the weather?”, Wit.ai will say that the text has an entity of type “intent” with value “weather”. When the user asks “What’s the weather in Brussels?”, Wit.ai will detect two entities one of type intent and one of type location.</p>

<p>A developer can then execute a function that will change the “context” according to the value of the entities. So if for example you ask “What’s the weather in Brussels?”, the developer can attach a “forecast” field to the context with the value “rainy in Brussels”. If you just ask “What’s the weather?”, the developer can attach a “missingLocation” field to the context with value “true”.</p>

<p>The conversation is implemented in a scenario. It starts with the text of the user containing certain entities. Then the bot will execute a function that will change the context. Based on the resulting context the bot can reply with different answers e.g. “What’s the weather in Brussels” -&gt; “The weather is rainy in Brussels” and “What’s the weather?” -&gt; “Where?”. The bot then waits for a reply to finish the scenario or a different phrase to start a new scenario.</p>

<p>Are you still following? No worries if you don’t. It took me a while to understand how everything works and to be honest I still do not completely understand it. It’s best that you follow their tutorial on their website. After I had made my own scenario things became much clearer.</p>

<h3>
<a id="conclusion-1" class="anchor" href="#conclusion-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h3>

<p>At first sight Wit.ai certainly has its limitations. A developer needs to do a lot of groundwork before he has a satisfying bot. Its biggest limitation is that it doesn’t truly understands what a user is asking. So you need to make a lot of scenarios to cover every edge case.</p>

<p>I haven’t explored the depths of Wit.ai so I don’t have yet a clear picture of what it’s capable off. My next step will be exploring its possibilities. </p>

<h2>
<a id="merging-the-projects" class="anchor" href="#merging-the-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Merging the projects</h2>

<p>The last step is to tie everything together. To integrate Wit.ai with my Beepboop project I take the code from the Wit.ai tutorial and put it in the Beepboop skeleton project. After some trial and error, I got everything working. </p>

<p>The biggest problem was knowing which function to call on the witClient (it’s runActions) and to let the bot reply to Slack (you need to register the message object to your own registration system so that Wit.ai can call that when it has a reply ready)</p>

<p>Be free to take a look at my code if you need some help implementing your own project.</p>

<a id="scenarios" class="anchor" href="#scenarios" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scenario’s</h1>

<p>Next on the list is implementing some complex scenarios to test the limits of Wit.ai and provide the business with some examples so they have an idea what they can expect of conversational bots.</p>
